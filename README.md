A Word Filter for filtering text.

A Word Filter is a system for identifying and censoring specific words or phrases in strings. Common
usage includes censoring vulgar or profane language and preventing spam or vandelism in 
user-provided content.

The Word Filter implementation provided here allows for advanced filtering functionality, including:
- Finding and censoring filtered words.
- Ignoring words that are considered "exceptions".
- Allowing specification of "aliases", i.e. strings that can replace other strings (for example, an
alias could be created to replace the letter "a" with the character "@").
- Ignoring specified separators (such as spaces or other characters) between letters of filtered
words.

A Word Filter is useful for checking and censoring user-generated text in chat applications, online
games, and many other contexts.

## Usage
This crate is intended to be used along-side the
[`word_filter_codegen`](https://crates.io/crates/word_filter_codegen) crate. A `WordFilter` is
created within the `build.rs` file at compile-time using a `WordFilterGenerator` from the
`word_filter_codegen` crate. See the documentation for further details.

### Example
For example, a simple `WordFilter` can be generated by the following.

First, add both the `word_filter` and `word_filter_codegen` crates to the `Cargo.toml`
`[dependencies]` and `[build-dependencies]` lists respectively. Be sure their versions match.

``` toml
[dependencies]
word_filter = "0.5.0"

[build-dependencies]
word_filter_codegen = "0.5.0"
```

Next, generate the `WordFilter` in the `build.rs` file.

``` rust
use std::{
    env,
    fs::File,
    io::{BufWriter, Write},
    path::Path,
};
use word_filter_codegen::{Visibility, WordFilterGenerator};

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new(&env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap()).join("codegen.rs");
    let mut file = BufWriter::new(File::create(&path).unwrap());

    writeln!(
        &mut file,
        "{}",
        WordFilterGenerator::new()
            .visibility(Visibility::Pub)
            .word("foo")
            .generate("FILTER")
        );
}
```

And finally, include the generated code in the `lib.rs` file.

``` rust
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/codegen.rs"));

assert!(FILTER.censor("Should censor foo."), "Should censor ***.");
```
